**ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System**

A simple and intuitive Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It allows users to select a movie and get five similar movie recommendations, complete with poster images fetched from the OMDB API.

**ðŸš€ Features**

Recommends 5 similar movies based on content similarity.

Displays movie posters using the OMDB API.

Clean and interactive web UI powered by Streamlit.

Utilizes precomputed similarity matrix for fast results.

**ðŸ§  How It Works**

A movie is selected by the user.

A similarity score (cosine similarity) is calculated from a precomputed matrix.

The top 5 most similar movies are retrieved.

Poster images are fetched in real time from the OMDB API using movie titles.

Recommendations are displayed side-by-side with posters and titles.
